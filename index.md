Riddle Cube is a puzzle game about speed.

The cube is solved as soon as all surfaces are on the cube. Tap on a surface to move it to the cube. But watch out!, each tile moves a different tile away from the cube and makes it more difficult to solve one side.

Different sizes of cube are available which increase the challenge of the game.
Solve the cube as fast as you can to buy a different look for your cube.
